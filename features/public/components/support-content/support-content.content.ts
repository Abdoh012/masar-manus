    question: "How do I create an account?",
    answer:
      "Click Start now in the header, choose whether you are a student or a company, and follow the steps. You'll confirm your email before your account is active.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Masar free for students?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Creating a profile, browsing trainings, and applying are free for students. Companies pay only if a placement is confirmed, never to browse candidates.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do companies verify my training?",
    answer:
      "When you complete a training, the company marks it complete and confirms the work you delivered. Masar then issues a verified certificate tied to your profile.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I apply to more than one training?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. You can apply to as many trainings as you like, and track every application from your dashboard so you never lose track of where you stand.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after I finish a training?",
    answer:
      "You earn a verified certificate and your completed work becomes part of your public profile, making it easier for other companies to find and hire you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who do I contact if something goes wrong?",

      "Reach us at support@masar.example with a short description of the issue and the email you signed up with. We typically reply within two business days.",
